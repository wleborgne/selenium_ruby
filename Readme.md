# Selenium Testing with Ruby

I recently purchased [Learning Selenium Testing Tools with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-selenium-testing-tools-python)
by Unmesh Gundecha.  As it happens, I am currently enrolled in a course where the main language is Ruby.  I have decided
to translate the example code in the books from Python to Ruby, both to refresh my Python knowledge
 and to augment my Ruby classwork.  This repository will hold the results of this effort.
